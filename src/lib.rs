//! ## [Architecture]
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! The following implementations are available:
//!
//! * `accelerate`, which is the one in the [Accelerate] framework (macOS only),
//! * `intel-mkl`, which is the one in [Intel MKL],
//! * `netlib`, which is the reference one by [Netlib],
//! * `openblas`, which is the one in [OpenBLAS], and
//! * `r`, which is the one in [R].
//!
//! An implementation can be chosen as follows:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! lapack-src = { version = "0.12", features = ["accelerate"] }
//! lapack-src = { version = "0.12", features = ["intel-mkl"] }
//! lapack-src = { version = "0.12", features = ["netlib"] }
//! lapack-src = { version = "0.12", features = ["openblas"] }
//! lapack-src = { version = "0.12", features = ["r"] }
